# Lab_03: Handling Vector Data ~ Network Analysis

## Introduction  

Network analysis in QGIS uses spatial data to model networks, such as roads or pathways. This allows for the calculation of routes and accessibility. It helps identify the best paths between locations by considering factors like distances and speed limits. This functionality supports transportation planning, navigation and solving geographic problems in urban areas. Check QGIS official documentation [QGIS network analysis documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/processing_algs/qgis/networkanalysis.html)

## üéØLearning Objectives
  
- **Apply network analysis tools to model spatial movement**
- **Differentiate between the shortest and fastest path algorithms in QGIS**
- **Critically evaluate cartographic visualization of network outputs**

## Data  

For access to the data follow this link: [Network_Analysis](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13WLpeKqzRLIn5P_BFIgyD9MovJgBhDVM?usp=sharing)

The folder `NetworkAnalysis_Data` contains two shapefiles:  
- `graz_districs_31287.shp`: 17 districts of Graz  
- `roads_31287.shp`: road network 

Additionally, a `max_speed_style` layer.  

The coordinate reference system (CRS) used for the layers is `EPSG:31287 - MGI / Austria Lambert`.

## Steps

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Launch QGIS**
- Launch QGIS  
- Start a new project. `Project` > `New` and save it right away. `Project` > `Save as` in your working folder. Give it a name like `Lab03_<YourName>`
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Add Layers**
From `Layer Menu`, add the following vector layers:
- Add road network 
- Add district polygon
- Add OSM basemap by selecting `Web` > `QuickMapServices` > `OSM` > `OSM Standard`

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create two point layers (student home and department)**
- `Layer` > `Create Layer` > `New Shapefile Layer`
- Set geometry to `Point`, CRS to `EPSG:31287` and file encoding to `UTF-8`
- Add attribute fields:
  - x_coord (decimal)
  - y_coord (decimal)
- Name your layer (`start_point`, `end_point`)
- Toggle editing mode, then use `Add Point Feature` to mark your home and the Geography Department
- Once points are added, double click the layer to go to `Attributes Form` where you have to select the x_coord field and set `$x` as a `Default value` and click `Apply default value on update`. Do the same for the y_coord and set `$y`. Press `Apply` and `OK`
- Save edits and check both points are close to the road network

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Run Network analysis**

**Shortest path (by foot)**
- Open the `Processing Toolbox` and type `Network analysis`
  - Firstly, select the `Shortest path (point to point)`
  - Select the roads layer and check that the coordinate system is the `EPSG:31287`
  - For the path type to calculate, select `Shortest`
  - Set the `Start Point` to be your home by clicking `...` and the `End Point` to be the Deparment of Geography
  - Set `Default Speed` as 5 km/h and leave everything else to default
  - Run the tool
  - Inspect the result and adjust the symbology 

> [!tip]
> Enable the snapping tool from the `Toolbar` to select your start and end points. Right-click and select `Snapping Toolbar`

**Fastest path (by car)**
- Load the `max_speed_style` layer by selecting the `roads_31287` layer. Right click `Properties` > `Symbology` > `Style` > `Load Style`
- As before, open the `Processing Toolbox` and type `Network analysis`
  - Repeat `Shortest path (point to point)`
  - Select the roads layer and check that the coordinate system is the `EPSG:31287`
  - For the path type to calculate, select `Fastest`
  - Keep the same start & end points from the previous step
  - In the `Advanced Parameters`, select `oneway` for the `Direction Field`
  - `Value for forward direction` set `F`
  - `Value for backward direction` leave empty
  - `Value for both directions` set `B`
  - For `Speed field` set the `maxspeed` and set the speed at 50 km/h
  - Set the `Topology Tolerance` to a value of `1 meter`
  - Run the tool
  - Inspect the result and adjust the symbology 

> ‚ùì**Question:** Click to see the answer    
<details>
  <summary>Did the fastest and shortest routes follow the same path?</summary>
  
  Often, they are different because speed limits and road types affect the fastest route. 
  </details>

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Map Layout for Presentation**  
- Open the **Print Layout** with **Project > New Print Layout**  
- Give your layout a name like `Network_Analysis_Map`  
- In the layout window, add your map with **Add Map** tool and draw a rectangle for it  
- Use the **Add Label** tool to add a big, clear title like *‚ÄúNetwork Paths‚Äù*  
- Add a legend, scale bar and north arrow
  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Export Your Map**  
- Once happy with the layout, export your map as an image:  
  - Click **Layout > Export as Image**  
  - Save the file in your project folder

---
## üöÄIndependently
- **Run the above network analysis tasks**
- **Optionally experiment by running network analysis for the fastest route between your points filtering the roads for cycling**
- **Write a brief report (3-4 pages max, including pictures) to explain how network analysis adapts to different travel modes (foot, using the car) and realistic speeds for your case**
- **Save your results into a PDF file (include text and screenshots from your steps) and send it by email till next week**
