# Lab 00: Introduction to GIS Fundamentals  

## üéØ Session Goals
- Discuss terminology of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  
- Learn about spatial data types and data structure in GIS  
- Recognize the importance of managing your GIS workspace effectively  
- Get acquainted with the QGIS software: what it is and how to install it

## 1. What is GIS? üåç    
GIS (Geographic Information System) is a technology for capturing, storing, analyzing and visualizing spatial or geographic data. It enables us to understand patterns, relationships and trends through maps and spatial analysis.

---
## 2. Key Concepts in GIS  
GIS uses different data types and structures to represent geographic features:

- **Spatial Data Types**: two main types‚Äîvector (points, lines, polygons) representing discrete features and raster (grid cells/pixels) representing continuous phenomena
- **Layers**: GIS maps are built from layers, each containing one type of spatial data
- **Attributes**: features in layers have associated data describing properties like names or measurements
- **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**: defines how spatial data corresponds to locations on Earth, ensuring accurate mapping

## 3. Organize Your Workspace üìÇ 
Proper organization of files prevents data loss and improves workflow efficiency.  

> [!TIP]  
> Create a dedicated project folder on your computer.  
> Inside that folder, create subfolders for:  
> - **Raw Data** (original, unmodified files)  
> - **Processed Data** (edited or analyzed versions)  
> - **Outputs** (final maps, exports, or reports)  
>   

## 4. File Naming Best Practices
QGIS file and folder names are *case sensitive* and sometimes sensitive to special characters. Avoid spaces (` `), umlauts (`√§`,`√∂`,`√º`) and special characters (`!`,`?`,`.`). Instead, use underscores `_` or hyphens `-`. For example:  
  - Use: `my_project.qgz`  
  - Avoid: `My Project.QGZ` or `my project.qgz`  

## 5. QGIS Project Files (`.qgz` or `.qgs`) 
These files save your workspace setup, including loaded layers, styles and layouts. Always save your project in your dedicated workspace folder and save frequently to avoid losing your work.

**Backing Up Your Data:**  
A good practice is to keep backup copies of data and project files in a different location or cloud storage to prevent accidental loss.

## 6. Intro to QGIS üó∫Ô∏è
QGIS is a free, open-source GIS software that enables users to work with spatial data easily. It supports a wide range of GIS tasks from data visualization to spatial analysis.

‚ÅâÔ∏è*Why use QGIS as our GIS software?*  

> **Answer:**  
> - It‚Äôs **free** and open-source, so accessible to everyone  
> - It supports a wide range of **data formats and coordinate systems**  
> - It combines **powerful GIS capabilities** with a friendly interface that beginners can quickly learn

## To Do: Install QGIS

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Download and Install QGIS**  
- Visit [https://qgis.org/en/site/](https://qgis.org/en/site/) and download the latest Long Term Release (LTR) english version suitable for your operating system  
- Follow the installation wizard prompts. Accept default settings unless you have specific needs  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Open QGIS and Explore the Interface**  
- When you launch QGIS, notice:  
  - **Menu Bar:** contains all available tools and settings  
  - **Toolbars:** quick access buttons for common functions
  - **Layers Panel:** manage which layers are visible and editable
  - **Browser Panel:** navigate files and data sources 
  - **Map Canvas:** main area where your map and data appear
  - **Processing Toolbox:** access advanced spatial analysis tools

## What‚Äôs Next? ‚è≠Ô∏è  
There is **no independent section to work on for Lab 00**, but it is essential that you download QGIS and grasp these foundational concepts before moving on. A solid understanding of GIS fundamentals will make working with QGIS in Lab 01 much smoother.

Take your time to familiarize yourself deeply with the concepts here before starting Lab 01.
