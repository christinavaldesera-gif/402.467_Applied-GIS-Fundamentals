| EPSG  (European Petroleum Survey Group)               | A standardized coding system for coordinate reference systems and map projections used worldwide in GIS software. |
| Georeferencing       | Aligning map data to real-world locations.                                                     |
| GIS (Geographic Information Systems)                 | A system to capture, analyze and map geographic information.                                  |
| GIS software         | Applications like QGIS used to create, view and analyze GIS data.                   |
| Map projection       | A way to show the round Earth on a flat map accurately.                                       |
| Metadata             | Information about the origin and details of data.                                             |
| Projection           | A technique for flattening the Earthâ€™s surface onto a 2D map.                                 |
| UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) |A coordinate system that divides the Earth into zones for accurate, local-scale mapping.                | 
| Raster data          | A grid of cells representing data like images or measurements.                                |
| Remote Sensing       | Collecting data about the Earth from satellites or planes.                                   |
| Scale                | Shows how much detail or area is on a map.                                                    |
| Spatial analysis     | Techniques for finding patterns or relationships in spatial data.                            |
| Spatial data         | Data showing where features are located on Earth.                                             |
| Vector data          | Geographic data represented by points, lines and polygons for detailed feature mapping.      |
